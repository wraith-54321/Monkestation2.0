// Effectively the same code as costume.dm but separated in order to reduce the length of the code.
// NOTE: I DID NOT CREATE ANY OF THE ART FOR THE PROJECT MOON OUTFITS. All credit for that goes to the original artists
// working on LC13. Some code and descriptions have also been reused from the same place. My art contributions include sprites
// for the EGOdrobe and its restock. Thank you to the original creators, and thank you to Project Moon for creating the
// games these originate from.

//Spritework for LC13 suits (including the arbiter cloak, clerk suits, W Corp jumpsuit all featured in
//code\modules\clothing\under\miscellaneous.dm and monkestation\code\modules\clothing\neck\cloaks.dm)
//were done by:
//Kitsunemitsu, InsightfulParasite, Mel Taculo, TemperanceTempy, Gwuhja, Yuraizz, Mann Handle and CrabbyTheCrab

// Base code for what the thing is and what it can hold (some of this will change when redefined
// by risk levels, realization, etc)
