		to provide ample protection to the user where the plating doesn't, with an illegal onboard electric powered \
		ablative shield module to provide resistance against conventional energy firearms. \
		In addition, it has an in-built chameleon system, allowing you to disguise the suit while undeployed. \
		A small tag hangs off of it reading; 'Property of the Gorlex Marauders, with assistance from Cybersun Industries. \
		All rights reserved, tampering with suit will void warranty."
