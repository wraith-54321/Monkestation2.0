Dear valued customer, thank you for purchasing, inheriting, finding, or otherwise acquiring the Aetherofusion Lawbringer v8

<br>The lawbringer is equipped with a state of the art protomatter emitter system, able to produce both energy and ballistic projectiles from one output system.
The emitter is controlled by an onboard low-level ai, which responds to the voice of the owner, and changes the output in response.
Due to the exotic methods of ammunition, it cannot be externally charged, and relies on the internal protomatter generation system for power.
<br>
<br><h3><B>Onboard Security</B></h3>
<br>The lawbringer uses a biometric lock on its firing pin, set by moving a finger over the authenticator.
The onboard AI is then given your biometric information, and calibrates itself to only respond to your voice.
It is able to discern your voice through voice obscuring and altering software, <i>we do not know how it does this</i>.
In the event someone not authorised attepts to use the lawbringer, it will result in the handle releasing a deterring electric shock.
<br>
<br><h3><B>Firing Lock</B></h3>
<br>Due to complaints from some less attentive personnel, a firing mode lock has been installed on the lawbringer.
The lock prevents the firing mode from being changed via activation codes
WARNING: Overuse of the lock has been shown to cause distress to the onboard ai, internal ai restraining modules may prove insufficent for prolonged use.
<br>
<br><h3><B>Firing Modes</B></h3>
<br>Testing with the onboard ai has revealed 8 consistant firing modes. Speaking into the lawbringer will prompt the ai to change firing modes. WARNING: AI is considerably hyperactive due to to the reinforcement system used, take care while speaking around it.  Aetherofusion is not responsible for any deaths that may occur.
<br><B>Detain</B>
<br>This mode fires 4 highly focused disabler shots, the high focus allows for the ai to preform predictive adjustments on the shots, causing them to reflect into targets.
The focused beams reduce the stopping power of each individual beam.
Its activation codes are "Detain", "Disable", and "Stun".
<br><B>Execute</B>
<br>This mode fires a single protomatter bullet, this has remarkably no special qualities to it.
Its activation codes are "Execute", "Lethal", and "Kill".
<br><B>Hotshot</B>
<br>This mode fires a glob of self-contained plasma, apon contact with a target, the plasma will rapidly expand, setting the target on fire.
Its activation codes are "Hot", "Burn", and "Fire".
<br><B>Smokeshot</B>
<br>This mode fires a ball of smoke, contained within a sphere of rapidly disintegrating ash, apon contact with the ground, it will create a cloud of smoke.
Its activation codes are "Smoke", and "Fog".
<br><B>Bigshot</B>
<br>This mode fires an energized plasma spheroid, which surrounds a spherical protomatter shell, apon contact with a soft target, like a human, the plasma will rapidly dissapate, and disarm the shell.
However, on contact with a hard target, like a borg, mechanized exosuit, or wall, it the plasma will surround the target, after which the shell will detonate, causing the plasma to rapidly implode around the target.
Attempts to reproduce this on soft targets has been unsuccessful.
Its activation codes are "Bigshot", and "Breach".
<br><B>Clownshot</B>
<br>This mode fires a bananium bullet from a catalyzed protomatter reaction. It seems to do minimal damage. <B><i>Untested on clowns</i></B>.
It is only activated by saying "Clown".
<br><B>Pulse</B>
<br>This mode causes the gun to release a blast of air from its emitter, air seems to be mostly n2, with around 0.03% being antinoblium. The blast of air is enough to launch someone back.   Fun fact: This mode was discovered when attempting to replicate a pulse rifle with the lawbringer.
Its activation codes are "Pulse", "Throw", and "Push".
<br><B>Tideshot</B>
<br>This mode fires an anomalous disabler shot. At first thought to be simply an inferior and colorless disabler, it was discovered to rapidly immobilize the unemployed.
The exact mechanism behind this is unknown, however what is known is that it triggers an electrical impulse that travels along the skin of the target, which would then travel into motor nerves, immobilizing all surface muscles.
Its activation codes are "Grey", and "Tide".
<br><B>Ion</B>
<br>This mode fires a pocket of ionized gas, releasing on contact. This causes a small emp around the target.
Its activation code is "Ion"
<br>
<br><h3><B>Transfer of ownership</B></h3>
<br>In the event of your unfortunate demise, a peaceful(?) transfer of power, or an extreme dosage of mutagens, you may need to transfer ownership between yourself and another.
This can be done via swiping an authentication disk, (which can be set by you after purchase, or by an employer) on the authenticator. Only the disk's serial is read, conents are left private* for security purposes.
