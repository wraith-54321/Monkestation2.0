Greetings operative.

<br>Your mission is to destroy the targeted Nanotrasen facility using it's own self destruct mechanism.
<br>
<br>Nanotrasen building codes usually place the self destruct terminal in the facility's high security vault.
You will need a Nanotrasen nuclear authentication disk to get through the first security barrier of the terminal.
The disk can be found on the captain or acting captain of the facility as they are are required to keep the disk on
their person at all times.
<B>Your pinpointer is set to track the disk to further aid in locating it.<B>
<br>
<br>The steps for activating the self destruct via the terminal are as follows:
<br>
<br> 1. Insert the nuclear authentication disk into the terminal.
<br>
<br> 2. Enter the five digit nuclear authorization code.
<br>
<br> 5. Set the timer by entering a time between 90 and 3600 seconds.
<br>
<br> 4. Arm the self destruct. Remove and take the disk to prevent disarmament of the self destruct mechanism.
<br>
<br> <B>THE FOLLOWING CODE MAY BE INCOMPLETE DUE TO INEFFECTIVE SECTOR SURVEILLANCE. AN OVERALL DIGIT MAY BE OMITTED.<B>
<br>
