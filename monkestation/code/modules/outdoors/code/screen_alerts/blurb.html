targets = mob or list of mobs to show it to.
duration = how long it lingers after it finishes ticking.
message = the message to display. Due to using maptext it isn't very flexible format-wise. 11px font, up to 480 pixels per line.
Use \n for line breaks. Single-character HTML tags (<b>, <i>, <u> etc.) are handled correctly but others display strangely.
Note that maptext can display text macros in strange ways, ex. \improper showing as &quot;ÿ&quot;. Lines containing only spaces,
including ones only containing &quot;\improper &quot;, don't display.
scroll_down = by default each line pushes the previous line upwards - this tells it to start high and scroll down.
Ticks on \n - does not autodetect line breaks in long strings.
screen_position = screen loc for the bottom-left corner of the blurb.
text_alignment = &quot;right&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, or &quot;center&quot;
text_color = colour of the text.
blurb_key = a key used for specific blurb types so they are not shown repeatedly. Ex. someone who joins as CLF repeatedly only seeing the mission blurb the first time.
ignore_key = used to skip key checks. Ex. a USCM ERT member shouldn't see the normal USCM drop message,
but should see their own spawn message even if the player already dropped as USCM.</em></td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/wraith-54321/Monkestation2.0/tree/e87cd5865da73e1fc78dbf3ac640d3e7369d7fa2">e87cd58</a> (master) — <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
