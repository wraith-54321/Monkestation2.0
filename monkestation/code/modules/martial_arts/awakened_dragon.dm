	<span class='notice'>While in combat mode (and not stunned, not a hulk, and not in a mech), you can reflect all projectiles that come your way, sending them back at the people who fired them! \n\
	Also, you are more resilient against suffering wounds in combat, and your limbs cannot be dismembered. This grants you extra staying power during extended combat, especially against slashing and other bleeding weapons. \n\
	You are not invincible, however- while you may not suffer debilitating wounds often, you must still watch your health and should have appropriate medical supplies for use during downtime. \n\
	In addition, your training has imbued you with a loathing of guns, and you can no longer use them.</span>")
