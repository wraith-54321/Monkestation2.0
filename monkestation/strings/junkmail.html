MAYDAY M''AADD DDAY, HEA LL P USS N O W GET THE EME R G E N CY  RESPONC- [The rest of the writing is smudged and slightly wet]
&lt;p&gt;[The paper appears to be badly worn from age]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome, gentlemen, to Nanotrasen.  Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians--you're here because we want the best, and you are it.  So, who's ready to make some science?&lt;p&gt;Now, you already met one another on the luxury shuttle ride over, so let me introduce myself.  I'm John Nanotrasen.  I own the place.  Transcribing this letter for me is the lovely Jacquelyn, my assistant.  Rest assured, she has transferred your honorarium to the charitable organization of your choice. Isn't that right, Jacquelyn? She's the backbone of this station. Pretty as a postcard, too. Sorry, fellas. She's married. To science.&lt;p&gt;There's a thousand tests performed every day here in our top-of-the-line departments. I can't personally oversee every one of them, so these letters will cover any questions you might have, and respond to any incidents that may occur in the course of your science adventure. Your test assignment will vary, depending on the manner in which you have bent your worlds to your will.&lt;p&gt;Those of you helping with the plasma harvesting today, just follow the green line to atmospherics.  Those who volunteered to be injected with lizard DNA, I've got some good news and some bad news.  Bad news is we're postponing those tests indefinitely. Good news is we've got a much better test for you: fighting an army of lizard men. Pick up a rifle and follow the blue line. You'll know when the test starts.&lt;p&gt;They say great science is built on the shoulders of giants. Not here. At Nanotrasen, we do all our science from scratch. No hand holding.
I own several IEDs for home defense, since that's what the founding greytiders intended. Four ruffians break into my house. &quot;What the devil?&quot; As I grab my soda cans and glass shard spear. Stab a golf ball sized hole in the first man, he's dead on the spot. Grab my IED and throw it the second man, miss him entirely because it's fuse is too short and it blows off my leg. I have to resort to the welding fuel tank and welder at the department doors, &quot;Tally ho lads&quot; the explosion consumes two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off fire alarms. Pick up a glass shard and crawl toward the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on security to arrive since jagged glass wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding greytiders intended.
&lt;p&gt;1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. &lt;p&gt;3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
There has been a change of circumstances.  Your current mission as it stands is considered failed.  You are to disregard all previous orders and information pertaining to your mission.  New orders will be delivered to your shortly by an agent identifying themselves as &quot;Mr. Yellow&quot;.  The agent will deliver your orders in confidence with the help of The Cone of Silence.

WANTED: Somebody to go back in time with me.  This is not a joke.  Meet me behind the holodeck, ask for Eric.  You'll get payed after we get back.  Must bring your own weapons.

Seeking: new mime.  I have ordered several mimes, and all of them have been woefully inadequate!  It's so hard to find a decent mime these days.  I gave them everything they could possibly need, took great care of them, but every one of them were too lazy to even fix me breakfast!  I even gave them the most advanced state-of-the-art kitchenware with heat management, burn safety functions, voice control, and quick pre-heating!  If you apply BE SURE that you can perform at least BASIC duties for me, I WILL NOT abide any more LAZY mimes and will leave you a terrible review on Space Yelp!

&lt;p&gt;Guys you'll never believe this story but it's 100% true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 14 years old I really wanted to play the new game &quot;Space Station 13&quot;, but my parents wouldn't buy it for me. So, one day I went to a garage sale low and behold, there was a copy of Space Station 13, but the disc was just an ordinary disc, and someone had just written &quot;SS13&quot; on it in a marker pen. It must have been a pirated copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I had known. what I know now. That is not ordinary copy of Space Station 13...........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I installed the game. It came with a warning, that said, 'maybe cause death'. I thought it was the developers trying to be funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I booted up the game, it wouldn't work properly, it would be a black screen. But then I messed around with the system files and I managed to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was just my PC acting up. Because my mom wouldn't let me buy a new graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I notice was that there was already a save file on the game. I thought that was strange. I opened it up and it took me to the character creation menu.............&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;except.........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the man standing in front of the mirror.........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;was DEAD!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I picked up my toolbox. The screen went black and I figured once again, maybe my, &quot;oh PC bugged out&quot;. But all of a sudden it skipped to what seemed like a few hours in the game, I was back in the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was talking to Head of Security. The only option it gave me........ was strangle. So I pressed the button&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and what happened next. Was an extremely graphic scene of my character cutting the circulation to Head of Security. He screamed in pain. And it wasn't lik any of the usual voice acting..... This sounded REAL..... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I swear when I looked into his eyes it was like the textures got hyper-realistic and I thought I saw a reflection of a person in it........ I thought I saw MYSELF!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but the familiar Byond UI, went from being painfully blue to...... BLOOD RED!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been playing this game for a long time now, and I've started to notice some things........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like there's shadows in the corner of my room. In REAL LIFE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played for another 20 hours. literally exploring every crack and crevise...... until finally...... i found the first crewmember I've seen in a literal day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a DEAD CLOWN! and he was still frozen like he was in SPACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started doing some research (on the dark web) I found a post that said. Actually, that during the production of Space Station 13, one of the beta testers was forced to play the game for 20 hours straight to see if there was any bugs with the game being played. for 20 hours straight. And the man DIED..... of dehydration. And then John Byond buried the body..... and he didn't want anyone to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something is not right. I feel like there's creatures all around me, Like in the game. I can see shuttles in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the worst part. I decided to webcam my friend but when I opened the call he said &quot;Why are you handing out with HEAD OF SECURITY?&quot;. And I said &quot;What? I'm all alone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my shock..... when the webcam turned on...... it wasn't my friend, as I expected...... It was THE John Byond, staring back at me! But his eyes were different, they were more evil..... His eyes were BLACK, and as though he had been crying blood! He opened his mouth and only static came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was terrified of what would happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the static though i could hear something.....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said &quot;if you die in the game...... you die in REAL LIFE..... Finish the game.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this isn't my last entry..... things are getting really bad now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went back to that neighbor's garage sale, and it turns out...... they've never even lived there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can end on one thing it's to say this. If you find a pirated game. at a garage sale............ DON'T play it.&lt;/p&gt;
