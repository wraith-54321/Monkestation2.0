                outside of one you can be squished by anyone stepping onto you,

                Whilst in a host you can provide many benefits, but also
                dangerous side-effects due to your sensitive brain manipulation.
                Here&apos;s how to prevent them
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                1. Whilst inside of a host we will passivelly make their health
                unable to be read due to our body obstructing the somatosensory
                cortex signals
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Prevention method - observe the hosts health carefully using
                &quot;Check Blood&quot;, heal any injuries and inform the host
                about any major wounds
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                2. Whilst inside of a host we will slowly deal toxin damage
                over-time up to 80 in total. This can be deadly when combined
                with any amount of brute/burn damage
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Prevention method - observe the hosts health carefully using
                &quot;Check Blood&quot;, inject toxin damage restoring chemicals
              </span>
              <br />
              <br />
              <span>
                3. Whilst inside of a host most of our actions will deal brain
                damage including generating evolution and chemical evolution
                points, due to either sensetivelly manipulating the host&apos;s
                neurons or needing to &quot;aquire&quot; more space for growth
              </span>
              <br />
              <span>
                Prevention method - observe the hosts health carefully using
                &quot;Check Blood&quot;, inject mannitol to cure brain damage,
                inject neurine for any brain traumas that might have been a
                result of our expansion
