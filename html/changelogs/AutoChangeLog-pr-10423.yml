changes:
  - balance: "Nerfs the base regen extract (the type that the rest derive from) from healing 5 dmg of every type per second -> 4."
  - balance: "Nerfs the purple regen extract from healing 10 dmg of every type per second -> 4."
  - balance: "Removes the extra diminishing penalty for the purple regen extract, so now every additional one (during the 90s cooldown) uses the standard 0.75 multiplier instead of 0.5."
