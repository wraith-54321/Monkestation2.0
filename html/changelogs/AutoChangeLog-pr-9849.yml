changes:
  - refactor: "Stamina is now maxed at 100 instead of 250."
  - rscdel: "Removes the rng chance to stamcrit when below 20% stamina threshold - you now simply go stamcrit at 0 stam damage."
  - bugfix: "Fixes several bugs related to stamina processing which caused certain effects to be delayed or inconsistent, and certain values to not be updated correctly when they should."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bunch of code that was referencing the unused \"staminaloss\" variable to instead reference the correct variable - as a result, basic/simple mobs are now affected by stamina damage (they are slowed by it, although still cant stamcrit)."
  - balance: "Makes space dragons (intentionally) unaffected by stamina damage."
  - bugfix: "Fixes several pieces of code using the non-functional \"setStaminaLoss()\" function."
  - admin: "Admin heals now always remove stamcrits, instead of being functional only some of the time."
  - bugfix: "Fixes energy armor so it actually works against disablers & other 'energy' type projectiles - armor will now protect you from ranged stamina damage. This also includes bullet armor for rubber rounds. Batons & tasers still pierce armor, however. Note that if you hit an arm or leg with stamina damage, it will instead check the armor on the target's chest, to prevent bypassing stamina armor by targeting limbs to stamcrit."
  - rscdel: "Removes the 'exhausted' status effect from the game."
  - rscdel: "Removes the 'debilitated' status effect from the game."
  - balance: "Removes the food buffs that increased your max stamina - they are instead all replaced with the food buffs that increase your natural stamina regen slightly (which has also been adjusted to account for the new stamina maximum)."
  - balance: "You now take gradually worsening slowdown from stamina damage. At 40, you lose the ability to sprint. At 60, you start taking damage slowdown just like regular damage. Like regular damage, the slowdown gets worse as your stamina damage gets higher."
  - balance: "Adjust a WHOLE bunch of stamina damage/healing values to account for the new max stamina. However, some values have been left unadjusted in cases where it appears they were never adjusted for 250 stamina in the first place. The most relevant adjustments are listed below - all numbers assume that all hits are landed within 2.5 seconds of each other, so the target cannot regen. The exact number of hits it takes to down someone, like before, will vary based on if they are sprinting and if they are allowed to regen stamina."
  - balance: "Added a 3 second stagger to flashes (not from behind still, though), identical to being shove staggered. Flashes now deal 60 stamina damage from the side (2 hits to stamcrit, 3 if target can regen a little) and 80 from the front (2 to stamcrit). The chance for flashes to instantly stamcrit you from the front has been removed. In addition, flashes now can no longer be chained on the same target while they are still blinded from the last flash - this immunity lasts about 2.5s, slightly shorter than the stagger."
  - balance: "Like regular flashes, you can no longer be affected by the 'flash' component of a flashbang while you are currently blinded from a previous flash (including a previous flashbang)."
  - balance: "Adds the flashbang box back as an option in the security utility voucher."
  - balance: "All batons now apply a short stagger (slowdown) for 3 seconds on each hit, identical to being shove staggered."
  - balance: "Stun batons deal 45 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint after 1 hit, and stamcrit in 3. They have also had their stun cooldown increased to 1.3s from 1s."
  - balance: "Police batons (the wooden ones) deal 45 stamina damage, same as a stun baton, but they still have a 1.5s stun cooldown."
  - balance: "Telebatons deal 55 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint in 1 hit and stamcrit in 2 hits, if the hits are landed close together. They have had their stun cooldown increased from 1.5s to 2s."
  - balance: "Contractor batons deal 80 stamina damage, along with the knockdown they still apply."
  - balance: "E-bows deal 60 stamina damage, which will slow in 1 hit and stamcrit in 2 on unarmored targets. They also still knockdown on the first hit."
  - balance: "Disablers and paco rubbers now each do 24 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint in 2 shots, slow in 3 shots, and stamcrit in 5 shots on unarmored targets."
  - balance: "Disabler smgs now do 11.5 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint in 4 shots, slow in 6 shots, and stamcrit in 9 shots on unarmored targets. They have also had their capacity very slightly increased from 40 to 42."
  - balance: "Beepsky now deals 60 stamina damage, which slows in 1 hit and stamcrits in 2 hits - though he does not slow you too much to be unescapeable after the first hit."
  - balance: "Dragnet netting shots now do 7 stamina damage each (still with 6 projectiles, so 42 per PB), which will prevent sprint in 1 PB shot, slow in 2, and stamcrit in 3 shots."
  - balance: "Rubbershot shotgun shells do 6 pellets of 10 stamina damage each (so 60 PB), which will slow in 1 shot if every pellet lands, and stamcrit in 2 PB shots."
  - balance: "Rejoice bartenders! Beanbag shotgun shells now do 55 stamina damage, which will no sprint (but not slow) in 1 shot and stamcrit in 2 shots (on unarmored targets)."
  - balance: "The relative regen rate of stamina has been slightly nerfed."
  - balance: "The duration of stamcrit has been slightly increased from 9 to 10 seconds, and after leaving stamcrit you will not be exhausted, but will have some stamina damage slowdown for about 5 seconds (by default). Natural stamina regeneration is still paused during stamcrit, but it is now possible to leave stamcrit early if other stamina regeneration brings you back to full stamina. The length of stamcrit still cannot be increased by repeated stunning."
  - balance: "The cost to sprint has been adjusted so that you can sprint for about 14-15 seconds before you hit the 40% no sprint threshold - about on par with how long you could sprint previously before hitting exhaustion."
  - balance: "You can no longer sprint while using a jetpack. You can still sprint while floating or flying with wings in 0g, however. The speed of ion jetpacks (and other slow jetpack types) has been buffed to compensate."
  - balance: "You can no longer stamcrit yourself by sprinting - this was previously janky and sometimes sprinting without stopping would cause you to stamcrit, other times to enter exhaustion. Now you simply cannot sprint when you hit 40% stamina damage, but you can still move normally. You are able to sprint again once your stamina damage falls below 30%."
  - balance: "Traitor stimulants no longer make you totally immune to stamcrit (in line with tg), but still give you baton resistance, higher movespeed, and stamina healing every tick."
  - code_imp: "TRAIT_STUNIMMUNE now makes you immune to taking all stamina damage except from sprinting."
  - code_imp: "TRAIT_BATON_RESISTANCE now prevents you from taking baton stagger as well as halving the stamina damage taken, but no longer outright prevents you from stamcritting from batons (and beepsky)."
