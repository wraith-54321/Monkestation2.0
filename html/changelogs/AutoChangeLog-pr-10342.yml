changes:
  - code_imp: "Adds thermal destabilization to temp gun. Prevents mob from homeostasis for 3 seconds and refreshes with every shot. This effects all temperature projectiles. Some examples are pyrokinesis, Watchers, Ice Demons, Earth bolt etc."
  - qol: "Can examine cores closer to see the items inside and pull those specific items out with a shorter duration."
  - qol: "Oozelings that are special revived not in a nugget state will reequip their items automatically."
  - bugfix: "Cultist revival now revives oozelings and will offer their bodies up if the player playing them is afk or they went souless."
  - balance: "Oozeling limb retraction now has a 2 second delay and incapacitation check to prevent intentional retractions while being cuffed."
  - balance: "Water vapor now affects oozelings. Starting at 1kPa partial pressure it will do lung and blood damage. Max damage occurs at 8kPa. Hydrophobia does not protect against this."
  - balance: "Basic mask filters can prevent breathing in of water vapor."
  - balance: "Festering ooze again lightly heals oozelings. Heal is weaker than a stabilized purple extract."
  - balance: "Specific security implants will get stored on death and reimplant upon revival of oozelings. Prevents oozeling antags from dying and reviving to remove the implants."
  - balance: "Black listed oozeling limbs from limb swapper causing issues for non-oozeling species."
  - balance: "Short spray cooldown so certain angles of extinguisher sprays doesn't completely drain oozeling's blood."
