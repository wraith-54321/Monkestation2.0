changes:
  - bugfix: "gauze works now and doesn't delete itself randomly when wounds change to a different type."
  - code_imp: "changed bandage overlays to be it's own layer instead of something attached to damage overlays."
  - balance: "reduced the absorption capacity of both improvised and regular gauze."
  - qol: "bandage overlays are colored corresponding to the gauze applied."
  - balance: "gauze now heals some burn and brute on first application over time. resting increases the amount of healing."
  - balance: "damage will knock off bandages."
  - code_imp: "moved code out of old modules to appropriate places."
  - balance: " used gauze is less sanitary."
  - rscadd: "adds plastiseal, it's basically advanced gauze. mixture of a potent regenerative mesh and better gauze. heals 30 burn and 15 brute on application. it's very effective for burn wounds and wounds in general. found in advanced and syndicate medkits. craftable via chemistry. recipe is 10 cellulose, 10 polyphyr, 10 spaceacillin, and 20 synthflesh. results in 6 plastiseal wraps."
  - balance: "patches apply a uniform 10% of the initial contained reagents each tick meaning patches only last 10 seconds now."
  - qol: "patches are now flammable."
  - bugfix: "fixed a bug where only one damage overlay would appear at a time."
  - bugfix: "added a missing damage overlay for stage three brute on the left leg."
  - balance: "damage overlays appear sooner to help with clarity."
  - bugfix: "spaceacillin now helps with burn wounds as stated in wound treatment solutions, slowing down the infection rate by a considerable amount for as long as it is metabolized."
  - balance: "emergency medipens have more spaceacillin to help treat burns wounds temporarily."
  - rscdel: "removed pain system medical items from medkits as pain isn't as prevalent anymore."
  - balance: "lowered the cost of advanced medkits to 450 from 600 credits in nanomed plus vendors."
  - bugfix: "fixed a runtime with fingerprints and chem explosions"
  - bugfix: "black powder explodes after 1-3 seconds instead of 5-10."
  - balance: "halved the rate at which fire heats you up."
  - code_imp: "moved some fire stack code to the appropriate places."
  - rscdel: "removed bruise and burn kits (heal packs)."
  - code_imp: "de-modularized gauze and chemical patch code."
  - bugfix: "bodies will only leave bloody trails if they are actually getting their blood dragged out on the floor."
  - rscadd: "added space trumpet seeds to seed vendors."
