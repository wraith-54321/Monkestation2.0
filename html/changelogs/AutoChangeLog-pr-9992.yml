changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds a new security status for sechuds - ‘Search’. Beepsky treats it like any other non-innocent status, but not like arrest. Credit to paradise station for the sprite."
  - rscadd: "Perma prisoners now start the round set to incarcerated. This includes prisoners with the jailbird quirk (who no longer start set to paroled if they are a prisoner)."
  - rscadd: "The ‘discharged’ security status text on the records console now implies that someone has been released, rather than acquitted."
  - qol: "Changes some of the colors on security statuses on the security records console to be more consistent with their sechud colors."
  - qol: "Changes the color of the suspected security hud to be teal, to prevent conflict with the orange incarcerated & search statuses."
  - qol: "As a regular member of security, you can now invalidate crimes on the records console which you have authored yourself. (requires HOS/warden access normally)."
  - bugfix: "You can now correctly edit the description on crimes in the records console."
  - bugfix: "You can now correctly invalidate citations, just like other crimes."
  - bugfix: "Both roundstart and latejoin perma prisoners now correctly have their flavor crimes added to their security records."
