  - refactor: Digitigrade lizard/satyr clothing no longer uses a separate icon for
      each individual piece of clothing, which was essentially doubling the resources
      you need to download to log in. Now it uses masking to change clothes to fit
      lizards when being equipped, which does mean there's a quality drop, but in
      exchange new clothes don't need to be sprited twice, any piece of clothing that
      does not have a lizard alt made will still fit digi lizards/satyrs (unless specifically
      excluded), and respriting clothes won't leave lizard alts using the old version.
  - refactor: Digitigrade shoes have been reworked to be based off of templates &
      masking, which further cuts on rsc size. This comes at the cost of plenty of
      shoes no longer fitting lizards, however these new shoes don't need to be constantly
      updated when a new shoe is added/removed/resprited (which is currently the reason
