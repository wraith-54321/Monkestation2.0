  Chelxox:
  - rscadd: 'Added three new felinid tails: leopard, double and big.'
  Gboster-0:
  - bugfix: macrobombs are no longer instant, this was broken for 3 months.
  Infernal-0:
  - qol: The CMO's unique rescue MODsuit now comes with a jetpack, patient transport,
      defibrillator and thread ripper module.
  JupiterJaeden:
  - bugfix: Vampires escape on shuttle objective now actually calculates correctly
      instead of always greentexting (oops).
  - bugfix: Vampires passive blood drain and health regeneration is now correctly
      adjusted for seconds per tick, which should make it more consistent across rounds.
  - bugfix: Vampires can now no longer go below 0 blood when dying from frenzy (or
      ever).
  - bugfix: "Vampires \u2018constant blood cost\u2019 for certain abilities now actually\
      \ works and drains blood constantly."
  - bugfix: Fixes an exploit with fortitude that would allow for infinitely reducing
      your brute & stamina modifiers. Credit to Ice-Type for bringing it to my attention.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with brawn that would cause your click intercept to be set
      for the full duration of the power cooldown when you used it to snap cuffs,
      leaving you unable to click on anything for a while.
  - bugfix: "Brawn now correctly allows you to snap handcuffs and knock the person\
      \ grabbing you down at the same time, when it\u2019s supposed to."
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug where vampires would not enter torpor when they should while
      teleporting to their coffin using vanishing act if the coffin was already closed.
  - balance: Vampires feed a little slower when using the giant plastic straw than
      before.
  - balance: "Nosferatu vampires now actually have an obvious tell when they are examined,\
      \ as their clan text implies: \u201CThey appear slouched over and grotesque\
      \ - a twisted abomination, like some shameless creature of the night\u2026\u201D"
  - balance: Vampires have had their passive health regen per level rate increase
      nerfed (the base regen + regen from current blood level is unchanged).
  - balance: 'Fortitude has been substantially changed: It is now once again unlimited
      duration, but no longer provides total stun immunity past level 4 (instead providing
      additional baton resistance at levels 4+), and has also had its brute and stamina
      resistance reduced: it starts at 20% rather than 40%, increases 5% per level
      instead of 10%, and is capped at 50% rather than 70%.'
  - balance: The (now functional) constant blood cost of fortitude has been increased
      from 0.2 to 3, but the activation cost has been dropped to 10 from 30.
  - balance: Brawn no longer allows you to break legcuffs at any level. Handcuff breaking
      is still at level 2, lockers at level 3, and silver cuffs at level 5.
  - balance: Brawn now always knock grabbers down, break out of closets, and snap
      restraints in the same use (assuming you have a high enough level for each feature).
      Which should make it more useful for escaping arrests or lockering.
  - balance: Mesmerize no longer mutes the target for the full duration regardless
      of if the glare succeeds or fails - but will still mute for the duration of
      the glare itself.
  - balance: "Tremere\u2019s dominate ability will now remove mindshields when used\
      \ to vassalize someone."
  - bugfix: Evil clones once again have glowing red eyes like they are supposed to.
