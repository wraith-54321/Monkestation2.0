  Chelxox:
  - rscadd: 'Added three new felinid tails: leopard, double and big.'
  Gboster-0:

  Infernal-0:
  - qol: The CMO's unique rescue MODsuit now comes with a jetpack, patient transport,
      defibrillator and thread ripper module.
  JupiterJaeden:
  - bugfix: Vampires escape on shuttle objective now actually calculates correctly
      instead of always greentexting (oops).
  - bugfix: Vampires passive blood drain and health regeneration is now correctly
      adjusted for seconds per tick, which should make it more consistent across rounds.
  - bugfix: Vampires can now no longer go below 0 blood when dying from frenzy (or
      ever).
  - bugfix: "Vampires \u2018constant blood cost\u2019 for certain abilities now actually\
      \ works and drains blood constantly."
  - bugfix: Fixes an exploit with fortitude that would allow for infinitely reducing
      your brute & stamina modifiers. Credit to Ice-Type for bringing it to my attention.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with brawn that would cause your click intercept to be set
      for the full duration of the power cooldown when you used it to snap cuffs,
      leaving you unable to click on anything for a while.
  - bugfix: "Brawn now correctly allows you to snap handcuffs and knock the person\
      \ grabbing you down at the same time, when it\u2019s supposed to."
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug where vampires would not enter torpor when they should while
      teleporting to their coffin using vanishing act if the coffin was already closed.
  - balance: Vampires feed a little slower when using the giant plastic straw than
      before.
  - balance: "Nosferatu vampires now actually have an obvious tell when they are examined,\
      \ as their clan text implies: \u201CThey appear slouched over and grotesque\
      \ - a twisted abomination, like some shameless creature of the night\u2026\u201D"
  - balance: Vampires have had their passive health regen per level rate increase
      nerfed (the base regen + regen from current blood level is unchanged).
  - balance: 'Fortitude has been substantially changed: It is now once again unlimited
      duration, but no longer provides total stun immunity past level 4 (instead providing
      additional baton resistance at levels 4+), and has also had its brute and stamina
      resistance reduced: it starts at 20% rather than 40%, increases 5% per level
      instead of 10%, and is capped at 50% rather than 70%.'
  - balance: The (now functional) constant blood cost of fortitude has been increased
      from 0.2 to 3, but the activation cost has been dropped to 10 from 30.
  - balance: Brawn no longer allows you to break legcuffs at any level. Handcuff breaking
      is still at level 2, lockers at level 3, and silver cuffs at level 5.
  - balance: Brawn now always knock grabbers down, break out of closets, and snap
      restraints in the same use (assuming you have a high enough level for each feature).
      Which should make it more useful for escaping arrests or lockering.
  - balance: Mesmerize no longer mutes the target for the full duration regardless
      of if the glare succeeds or fails - but will still mute for the duration of
      the glare itself.
  - balance: "Tremere\u2019s dominate ability will now remove mindshields when used\
      \ to vassalize someone."
  - bugfix: Evil clones once again have glowing red eyes like they are supposed to.

2025-12-27:

      if you were currently at your vassal cap.
  - map: Added a proper SMES for the SM emitters on Void Raptor.

      you for not blowing up [PHARMACY/ENGINE] in regular rounds)
  - code_imp: Adds multiple bitrunning networks functionality
  Tractor-Maam:
  - balance: Vital Displays are available to print as a design roundstart. Advanced
      displays are still untouched under Advanced Biotech.
  Veth-s:
  - rscadd: A new token statpanel for admins, to help improve token responses.
  - admin: A noise will now play if a token is going to timeout in one minute.
2025-12-28:
  Infernal-0:
  - spellcheck: Updates the description for the CMOs surgical processor.
  JohnFulpWillard:
  - bugfix: Sandevistan implants & Sugar/Hen rushes properly display an afterimage
      as you move around.
  - bugfix: Helio permabrig entrance doors have had their access fixed.
  - rscadd: Union badges hold access for union related activities (union management
      app)
  - rscadd: The QM can now replace their golden union badge.
  JupiterJaeden:
  - refactor: Stamina is now maxed at 100 instead of 250.
  - rscdel: Removes the rng chance to stamcrit when below 20% stamina threshold -
      you now simply go stamcrit at 0 stam damage.
  - bugfix: Fixes several bugs related to stamina processing which caused certain
      effects to be delayed or inconsistent, and certain values to not be updated
      correctly when they should.
  - bugfix: Fixes a bunch of code that was referencing the unused "staminaloss" variable
      to instead reference the correct variable - as a result, basic/simple mobs are
      now affected by stamina damage (they are slowed by it, although still cant stamcrit).
  - balance: Makes space dragons (intentionally) unaffected by stamina damage.
  - bugfix: Fixes several pieces of code using the non-functional "setStaminaLoss()"
      function.
  - admin: Admin heals now always remove stamcrits, instead of being functional only
      some of the time.
  - bugfix: Fixes energy armor so it actually works against disablers & other 'energy'
      type projectiles - armor will now protect you from ranged stamina damage. This
      also includes bullet armor for rubber rounds. Batons & tasers still pierce armor,
      however. Note that if you hit an arm or leg with stamina damage, it will instead
      check the armor on the target's chest, to prevent bypassing stamina armor by
      targeting limbs to stamcrit.
  - rscdel: Removes the 'exhausted' status effect from the game.
  - rscdel: Removes the 'debilitated' status effect from the game.
  - balance: Removes the food buffs that increased your max stamina - they are instead
      all replaced with the food buffs that increase your natural stamina regen slightly
      (which has also been adjusted to account for the new stamina maximum).
  - balance: You now take gradually worsening slowdown from stamina damage. At 40,
      you lose the ability to sprint. At 60, you start taking damage slowdown just
      like regular damage. Like regular damage, the slowdown gets worse as your stamina
      damage gets higher.
  - balance: Adjust a WHOLE bunch of stamina damage/healing values to account for
      the new max stamina. However, some values have been left unadjusted in cases
      where it appears they were never adjusted for 250 stamina in the first place.
      The most relevant adjustments are listed below - all numbers assume that all
      hits are landed within 2.5 seconds of each other, so the target cannot regen.
      The exact number of hits it takes to down someone, like before, will vary based
      on if they are sprinting and if they are allowed to regen stamina.
  - balance: Added a 3 second stagger to flashes (not from behind still, though),
      identical to being shove staggered. Flashes now deal 60 stamina damage from
      the side (2 hits to stamcrit, 3 if target can regen a little) and 80 from the
      front (2 to stamcrit). The chance for flashes to instantly stamcrit you from
      the front has been removed. In addition, flashes now can no longer be chained
      on the same target while they are still blinded from the last flash - this immunity
      lasts about 2.5s, slightly shorter than the stagger.
  - balance: Like regular flashes, you can no longer be affected by the 'flash' component
      of a flashbang while you are currently blinded from a previous flash (including
      a previous flashbang).
  - balance: Adds the flashbang box back as an option in the security utility voucher.
  - balance: All batons now apply a short stagger (slowdown) for 3 seconds on each
      hit, identical to being shove staggered.
  - balance: Stun batons deal 45 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint after 1
      hit, and stamcrit in 3. They have also had their stun cooldown increased to
      1.3s from 1s.
  - balance: Police batons (the wooden ones) deal 45 stamina damage, same as a stun
      baton, but they still have a 1.5s stun cooldown.
  - balance: Telebatons deal 55 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint in 1 hit
      and stamcrit in 2 hits, if the hits are landed close together. They have had
      their stun cooldown increased from 1.5s to 2s.
  - balance: Contractor batons deal 80 stamina damage, along with the knockdown they
      still apply.
  - balance: E-bows deal 60 stamina damage, which will slow in 1 hit and stamcrit
      in 2 on unarmored targets. They also still knockdown on the first hit.
  - balance: Disablers and paco rubbers now each do 24 stamina damage, which will
      prevent sprint in 2 shots, slow in 3 shots, and stamcrit in 5 shots on unarmored
      targets.
  - balance: Disabler smgs now do 11.5 stamina damage, which will prevent sprint in
      4 shots, slow in 6 shots, and stamcrit in 9 shots on unarmored targets. They
      have also had their capacity very slightly increased from 40 to 42.
  - balance: Beepsky now deals 60 stamina damage, which slows in 1 hit and stamcrits
      in 2 hits - though he does not slow you too much to be unescapeable after the
      first hit.
  - balance: Dragnet netting shots now do 7 stamina damage each (still with 6 projectiles,
      so 42 per PB), which will prevent sprint in 1 PB shot, slow in 2, and stamcrit
      in 3 shots.
  - balance: Rubbershot shotgun shells do 6 pellets of 10 stamina damage each (so
      60 PB), which will slow in 1 shot if every pellet lands, and stamcrit in 2 PB
      shots.
  - balance: Rejoice bartenders! Beanbag shotgun shells now do 55 stamina damage,
      which will no sprint (but not slow) in 1 shot and stamcrit in 2 shots (on unarmored
      targets).
  - balance: The relative regen rate of stamina has been slightly nerfed.
  - balance: The duration of stamcrit has been slightly increased from 9 to 10 seconds,
      and after leaving stamcrit you will not be exhausted, but will have some stamina
      damage slowdown for about 5 seconds (by default). Natural stamina regeneration
      is still paused during stamcrit, but it is now possible to leave stamcrit early
      if other stamina regeneration brings you back to full stamina. The length of
      stamcrit still cannot be increased by repeated stunning.
  - balance: The cost to sprint has been adjusted so that you can sprint for about
      14-15 seconds before you hit the 40% no sprint threshold - about on par with
      how long you could sprint previously before hitting exhaustion.
  - balance: You can no longer sprint while using a jetpack. You can still sprint
      while floating or flying with wings in 0g, however. The speed of ion jetpacks
      (and other slow jetpack types) has been buffed to compensate.
  - balance: You can no longer stamcrit yourself by sprinting - this was previously
      janky and sometimes sprinting without stopping would cause you to stamcrit,
      other times to enter exhaustion. Now you simply cannot sprint when you hit 40%
      stamina damage, but you can still move normally. You are able to sprint again
      once your stamina damage falls below 30%.
  - balance: Traitor stimulants no longer make you totally immune to stamcrit (in
      line with tg), but still give you baton resistance, higher movespeed, and stamina
      healing every tick.
  - code_imp: TRAIT_STUNIMMUNE now makes you immune to taking all stamina damage except
      from sprinting.
  - code_imp: TRAIT_BATON_RESISTANCE now prevents you from taking baton stagger as
      well as halving the stamina damage taken, but no longer outright prevents you
      from stamcritting from batons (and beepsky).
  - bugfix: Patches an oversight allowing you to bypass baton stun cooldown by switching
      to a new baton.
  Lawlolawl:
  - balance: Disabled wastes pins on Oshan station Z, completely (even far away from
      station exterior).
  - bugfix: Allowed shooting of wastes pin weapons around the exterior of the Oshan
      mining base (previously blocked shooting when too close).

  - rscdel: removed brig physician vouchers, Brig Physician starts with a security
      handheld crew monitor in their locker and belt.

  - bugfix: IPCs get drunk with exactly the same drunkenness math as people, instead
