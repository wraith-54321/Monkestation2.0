changes:
  - bugfix: "RTG's now produce accurate amounts of power, instead of around half. this should help deep storage significantly with power"
  - bugfix: "PTL's no longer will heal you if under 25 MW, and now will properly try to kill you normally without gibbing,"
  - bugfix: "PTL's will no longer have access to twice the amount of power actually in the power network"
  - bugfix: "Ethereals charge rates have been increased/decreased. Some safer activites should include apc's, lights, and rechargers not instantly overcharging, and ethereal cores instantly draining players. Numbers are rough still"
