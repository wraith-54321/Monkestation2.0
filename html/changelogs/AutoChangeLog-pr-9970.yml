changes:
  - bugfix: "Vampires escape on shuttle objective now actually calculates correctly instead of always greentexting (oops)."
  - bugfix: "Vampires passive blood drain and health regeneration is now correctly adjusted for seconds per tick, which should make it more consistent across rounds."
  - bugfix: "Vampires can now no longer go below 0 blood when dying from frenzy (or ever)."
  - bugfix: "Vampires ‘constant blood cost’ for certain abilities now actually works and drains blood constantly."
  - bugfix: "Fixes an exploit with fortitude that would allow for infinitely reducing your brute & stamina modifiers. Credit to Ice-Type for bringing it to my attention."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug with brawn that would cause your click intercept to be set for the full duration of the power cooldown when you used it to snap cuffs, leaving you unable to click on anything for a while."
  - bugfix: "Brawn now correctly allows you to snap handcuffs and knock the person grabbing you down at the same time, when it’s supposed to."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a bug where vampires would not enter torpor when they should while teleporting to their coffin using vanishing act if the coffin was already closed."
  - balance: "Vampires feed a little slower when using the giant plastic straw than before."
  - balance: "Nosferatu vampires now actually have an obvious tell when they are examined, as their clan text implies: “They appear slouched over and grotesque - a twisted abomination, like some shameless creature of the night…”"
  - balance: "Vampires have had their passive health regen per level rate increase nerfed (the base regen + regen from current blood level is unchanged)."
  - balance: "Fortitude has been substantially changed: It is now once again unlimited duration, but no longer provides total stun immunity past level 4 (instead providing additional baton resistance at levels 4+), and has also had its brute and stamina resistance reduced: it starts at 20% rather than 40%, increases 5% per level instead of 10%, and is capped at 50% rather than 70%."
  - balance: "The (now functional) constant blood cost of fortitude has been increased from 0.2 to 3, but the activation cost has been dropped to 10 from 30."
  - balance: "Brawn no longer allows you to break legcuffs at any level. Handcuff breaking is still at level 2, lockers at level 3, and silver cuffs at level 5."
  - balance: "Brawn now always knock grabbers down, break out of closets, and snap restraints in the same use (assuming you have a high enough level for each feature). Which should make it more useful for escaping arrests or lockering."
  - balance: "Mesmerize no longer mutes the target for the full duration regardless of if the glare succeeds or fails - but will still mute for the duration of the glare itself."
  - balance: "Tremere’s dominate ability will now remove mindshields when used to vassalize someone."
