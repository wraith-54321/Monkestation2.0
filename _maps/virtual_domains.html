<li>Create a new map using TGM format. It can be any size, but please, consider limiting to 75x75 max.</li>
<li>Ensure that the map has ONE tile marked with the safehouse bottom left landmark. If you're using modular safehouses, it will need to be a 7x6 area.</li>
<li>Provide a way for players to enter your new map via the north door, which is 4th tile over.</li>
<li>Enclose your area with a single wall binary closed wall.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="from-an-existing-map">From an existing map</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a new map using the existing map's size - give yourself enough room to enclose it with a binary wall. There's no need for any space outside of it, so ensure that it fits and is enclosed, nothing outside of this.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the existing map into it.</li>
<li>Find an accessible area for a safehouse, 7x6 - or with a custom, just ensure the necessary landmarks are placed.</li>
<li>Place a bottom left safehouse landmark somewhere on the map to load the safehouse.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="both">BOTH.</h2>
<ol>
<li>You need to have one (1) way that the encrypted cache can spawn. This can be from a mob drop, a landmark (place a few, it'll pick one), or a signable landmark if you have a points system.</li>
<li>Make note of the size of the map. Make sure this is in the dm file.</li>
<li>Create the dm file that defines the map qualities. Examples are in the bitrunning file.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>You shouldn't need to fully enclose your map in 15 tiles of binary filler. Using one solid wall should do the trick.</p>
<p>Adding some open tile padding around the safehouse is a good touch. About 7 tiles West/East for the visual effect of a larger map.</p>
<p>If you want to add prep gear, you can do so within the safehouse's area as long you don't overlap with goal turfs or exit spawners. The top left corner is a good spot for this, with respect for the walls, therefore [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]</p>
<p>You can also create safehouses if you find yourself needing the same gear over and over again. There is a readme for that as well.</p>
<p>Boss zones should give players pretty ample space, I've been using a 23x23 minimum area.</p></td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/wraith-54321/Monkestation2.0/tree/e87cd5865da73e1fc78dbf3ac640d3e7369d7fa2">e87cd58</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
